# TW-Analytics
TW-Analytics creates visualizations of the sentiment surrounding currently trending topics on Twitter.
Visualizations include pie charts showing the percentage of users who have a positive, negative, or neutral view of the
topic at hand, as well as "snapshot" images which contain only a percentage and small text blurb explaining the
attribute that percentage shares.

_Created by Evan Donohue, Brian Mirabito, and Sangu Mbekelu for BrickHack 6._
